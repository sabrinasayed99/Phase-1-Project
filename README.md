## S.J. Corporation Fleet Addition

#### Author: [Sabriana Sayed](https://github.com/sabrinasayed99), [Jessie Freeelander](https://github.com/Anicca18)


## Overview:

The project has utilized a dataset of over 88,000,000 aviation accident events to create a list of the most effective and safe aircraft. To gauge safety, a risk index was developed, which included a cluster of data utilizing injury and fatality ratios. The Phase 1 Project can be used as a recommendation for the safest and most effective aircraft for S & J Corporation to add to their fleet.

## Business Problem:

S.J. Corporation is undergoing massive expansion within North America, which is creating a governing factor on the outputs of the C-Suite. S.J. Corporation will experience an increase in output and efficiency by choosing to add a private aircraft to the balance sheets. Choosing the right aircraft will provide C-Suite executives with efficiency, comfort, and safety.


## Data:

S.J. Corporation is working with a data set from the National Transportation Safety Board that includes aviation accident data from 1962 to 2023 about civil aviation accidents and selected incidents in the United States and international waters.

## Methods:

The risk index was divided into categorical buckets of "High Risk," "Medium Risk," and "Low Risk." A very high positive correlation between average fatalities and risk values validates our risk index as a metric for safety.

## Results:

The Risk index was subsetted into categorical buckets of "High Risk", "Medium Risk", and "Low Risk". With a very high postive correlation between average fatalites and Risk values, validates our risk index as a metric for saftey.

Utilizing a heat map, S.J. Corporation is able to narrow their findings to the makes and models of aircraft that would be suitable for the company. From this list of highly efficient and safe aircraft, the board may choose the aircraft that upholds the company's expectations.

## Conclusions

The analysis leads to three recommendations for the make and model of the aircraft S.J. Corporation will be adding to the fleet. These recommendations come from the list of low-risk aircraft that have an average risk value of less than 0.05, two engines, and a history with more than a 0.6 average uninjured rate.

    Cessna 206: 
                Risk index < .05
                Unijured Rate > .60
                Two Engines
    Cessna 208: 
                Risk index < .05
                Unijured Rate > .60
                Two Engines
    Piper Pa-32: 
                Risk index < .05
                Unijured Rate > .60
                Two Engines
